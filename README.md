# HOTEL: An Earthbound-Inspired Booking System

HOTEL is a unique hotel booking web application built with ASP.NET, drawing heavy inspiration from the visual style and quirky charm of the beloved SNES RPG, Earthbound. This project reimagines the often mundane process of online booking by infusing it with retro pixel art, thematic room descriptions, and a nostalgic user interface.

Beyond the core booking functionality, HOTEL aims to deliver a memorable and entertaining user experience by incorporating playful, Earthbound-esque elements. It serves as a demonstration of how thematic design and gamification can transform a standard web application into something more engaging and distinct.

**Video Demo:** [Hotel Demo (Earthbound SNES)](https://youtu.be/0BRPYHUQIsI)
*Summary:* The video demonstrates a concept for a hotel booking system designed in the style of the Earthbound SNES game. It showcases the user interface for Browse different hotel rooms with their descriptions and prices [00:07], selecting check-in and check-out dates [00:07], adding rooms to a cart [00:07], and proceeding to a checkout screen [00:35]. The demo also includes a form for entering personal and billing information [00:57], and a sequence where the character receives a cookie after checking in [01:39]. Later in the video, it transitions to a battle scene with a spider-like creature [02:44] and shows a list of names, possibly for a "lost souls" concept [02:44].

Developed for Object Oriented Programming II course, December 2015.
