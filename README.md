# HOTEL: An Earthbound-Inspired Booking System

HOTEL is a unique hotel booking web application built with ASP.NET, drawing heavy inspiration from the visual style and quirky charm of the beloved SNES RPG, Earthbound. This project reimagines the often mundane process of online booking by infusing it with retro pixel art, thematic room descriptions, and a nostalgic user interface.

Beyond the core booking functionality, HOTEL aims to deliver a memorable and entertaining user experience by incorporating playful, Earthbound-esque elements. It serves as a demonstration of how thematic design and gamification can transform a standard web application into something more engaging and distinct.
